/**
 * The gateway is the authority on whether consent exists, and the two records
 * can legitimately diverge: deleting the account and re-enabling the cloud
 * creates a *new* anonymous user, and that user has no consent row.
 *
 * When that happens the screen said "Consent is active" while every analysis
 * was refused, and the only button was "Withdraw" — a dead end with no way
 * back. The local record has to yield to the server's verdict.
