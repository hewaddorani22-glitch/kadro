          'For access control, Supabase stores once against your account ID which access applies to you, or why you are not assigned to a test variant, and when. The earlier limited access test for new installs by adults with no prior use is paused: no new variants are assigned. For accounts created after the current access model was introduced, Supabase also stores the ID and time of the one free meal so that Kandro Pro applies afterwards; this record is deleted with the account. Existing assignments remain until account deletion and are not redrawn at sign-in or restore. Individual permissions for meal saves already begun preserve their later synchronization. When the paywall is shown to you, Supabase also stores against your account ID in which context (for example after the free analyses) and when it first appeared; this record is deleted with the account as well. Optional events about the paywall actually shown remain subject to your separate analytics consent. No device fingerprinting is used.',
          'On your device, Kandro processes your profile, your targets, weight entries, confirmed meals and at most three failed, compressed photo scans kept for a retry you trigger yourself.',
          'Optional daily reminders are scheduled locally and contain no nutrition totals. In your profile, you can allow home screen widgets to show today’s calories, protein and confirmed targets on this device. Without this choice, and on the Lock Screen, widgets only offer shortcuts. A protected shared app container holds a small, time-limited daily snapshot without names, meal descriptions, images or credentials. Turning sharing off clears it; iOS may briefly retain a previously rendered widget image. Local usage and request counters limit the optional native review request; Kandro does not upload these counters.',
          'When the cloud is active, Supabase stores in the EU a random account ID, your profile, your current targets, confirmed meals, ingredients, recommendations and feedback. Weight entries stay on your device; an email address is only stored if you deliberately secure your guest account. If you secure it with Sign in with Apple, Apple provides an identifier for your Apple ID and an email address that Apple can relay anonymously at your choice; Kandro never receives your Apple password. If you speak a meal, Apple speech recognition turns it into text, on the device where possible and otherwise via Apple. Kandro stores no audio, only the text you send.',
          'When you save a product as “My product” (from a photographed nutrition label or entered yourself), Kandro stores its name, optionally brand and barcode, the values per 100 g you confirmed, and serving and pack size on your device and, when the cloud is active, in Supabase in the EU. You can delete each product individually; all of them are deleted with your account.',
          'To prevent automated exhaustion of USDA, Open Food Facts and RevenueCat, Supabase keeps per-provider counters linked to one-way pseudonyms of the random account ID and source network for at most two hours after their last use. Food queries and barcodes are not stored in these counters.',
          'Kandro is for people aged 16 and over. Older app versions let users aged 14 or 15 ask a parent or legal guardian to approve by an emailed link. As long as such requests still arrive, the following applies: the guardian email exists only in the delivery function’s working memory and is not stored in Kandro’s database. Until confirmation or expiry after 48 hours, Supabase stores only the pending request with a hash of the single-use token. To prevent automated guardian-email abuse, each request also consumes atomic limits based on separately salted hashes of the app account, source network and guardian email. The raw network address and guardian email are not stored for this purpose, and these separate rate-limit records are deleted within three hours. After successful confirmation, the request is deleted immediately; the confirmation time and notice version remain in the protected profile as evidence. Resend processes the address and technical delivery data to send the message.',
          'If the app crashes or a serious technical error occurs, Kandro sends an error report to Sentry (Functional Software, Inc.; stored in the EU region, Frankfurt). It contains the sanitised error with its code location, app version, device model, operating system, a random installation identifier and the last interface steps without any input. Without an error, Sentry only counts the start and end of app sessions to measure the share of crash-free sessions, and may record technical load times for a small share of sessions. Kandro does not send an account ID, email address, IP address, photos, screen contents, typed text, foods, calories or body data. The legal basis is our legitimate interest in a stable, error-free app (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR); error reports are deleted after no more than 90 days.',
          'If you deliberately enable optional usage analytics, PostHog receives a random Distinct or device ID persisted on the device, allowlisted feature events, sanitised errors and technical app-version, operating-system and SDK information. Photos, email addresses, foods, calories, macros and Supabase IDs are not sent to PostHog.',
          'For subscription management, RevenueCat receives the random Supabase account ID as a Custom App User ID, plus product, purchase, duration and entitlement information. This lets Kandro associate and restore a purchase for the same account; RevenueCat receives no meals, body details or nutrition data.',
          "Only with your separate, default-off consent to analysis of the now paused subscription experiment does RevenueCat additionally receive the fixed experiment identifier, your original A/B variant and consent version. These are linked to your account ID and subscription information. Apple checks the installation origin; Kandro exposes only an App Store, test or unknown category to the app, not receipts, transaction data or device identifiers. Test and uncertain installations are excluded from this measurement. Earlier consent to PostHog usage analytics does not cover this purpose.",

USDA FoodData Central is then queried with text search terms only. For a barcode, the number is looked up at Open Food Facts through the Kandro analysis gateway.',

The legal basis is your explicit consent under Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, which you give during onboarding and can withdraw at any time under “You → Analysis & data use” with effect for the future. After withdrawal, Kandro sends no analysis, body or nutrition data to the named recipients. Consent is stored with a timestamp and notice version on your device and, when the cloud is active, in your protected profile.',
          'Kandro is available from age 16; from 16 you can consent for yourself under Art. 8 GDPR in Germany. Where a parent approved through an older app version, they confirmed the disclosed recipients and purposes through a single-use link that expires after 48 hours. After successful confirmation, the request and token hash are deleted immediately; a daily database job removes expired requests. A given authorization can be withdrawn through the contact address above; future processing can also be stopped in the app at any time.',
          'Local data remains until you delete the app data or your account. Confirmed meals are stored locally for your history; for the cloud history the app currently loads at most 90 days. Cloud data remains until the account is deleted. Technically necessary backups may expire according to the retention periods of the respective processor.',
          'To recover a successful analysis after an interrupted response and prevent free or Pro allowances from being counted twice, Supabase stores the structured nutrition result with a random request ID and your account ID. The photo, Base64 working copy, prompt and typed raw text are not stored for this purpose. An hourly job clears the result after 22 hours. The request ID, status and allowance type then remain for at most 30 days to prevent duplicate calls and abuse; RevenueCat webhook IDs remain for at most 90 days for deduplication. Account deletion immediately cascades to these Kandro records.',
          'To understand whether Kandro actually helps new users and where analyses fail, we evaluate data that Supabase already holds to run the service, only in aggregated form as counts per sign-up day. We count, for example, how many new accounts created a profile, tried or successfully completed an AI analysis, saved a meal (on the first day, from the second day or from the eighth day), saw the paywall or started a trial or subscription, how many of them are adults, and for which technical reasons analyses fail. For meals, only whether and when something was saved counts, not what. No additional data is collected for this, no nutrition values, body data or photos are evaluated, no profiles of individual people are built and nothing is passed to analytics services or other third parties; only the provider has access through the protected database. The legal basis is our legitimate interest in improving Kandro and finding errors (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). You can object to this evaluation under Art. 21 GDPR through the contact address above.',
          'Voluntarily transmitted PostHog events remain until the retention configured for the EU project expires or a valid erasure request is completed. Switching analytics off stops future transmission and clears the random local analytics identity and pending event queues. PostHog never receives the Supabase account ID, so previously sent events cannot be joined to the deleted Kandro account. Apple may keep purchase and subscription history as long as needed for restoration, billing, fraud prevention or legal duties. OpenRouter does not retain prompt or response content, but keeps content-free request metadata under its own retention criteria.',
          "You can turn off subscription experiment analysis under You or on the paywall. New attribute transmissions stop immediately; previously set Kandro RevenueCat attributes are removed at the next possible sync. Subscription management, purchase rights and functional access assignment remain unchanged. Your choice and any pending removal are stored locally per account; account deletion also removes the RevenueCat customer. This does not guarantee retroactive removal from already aggregated reports.",

Kandro asks RevenueCat to complete or durably queue that erasure before destroying the account join ID.

Separately, OpenRouter stores content-free request metadata such as timestamp, model used, token counts and latency for billing, reporting and model ranking.
