          'To prevent automated exhaustion of USDA, Open Food Facts and RevenueCat, Supabase keeps per-provider counters linked to one-way pseudonyms of the random account ID and source network for at most two hours after their last use. Food queries and barcodes are not stored in these counters.',

The guardian email exists only in the delivery function’s working memory and is not stored in Kandro’s database. Until confirmation or expiry after 48 hours, Supabase stores only the pending request with a hash of the single-use token. To prevent automated guardian-email abuse, each request also consumes atomic limits based on separately salted hashes of the app account, source network and guardian email. The raw network address and guardian email are not stored for this purpose, and these separate rate-limit records are deleted within three hours. After successful confirmation, the request is deleted immediately; the confirmation time and notice version remain in the protected profile as evidence.

After withdrawal, Kandro sends no analysis, body or nutrition data to the named recipients. Consent is stored with a timestamp and notice version on your device and, when the cloud is active, in your protected profile.',

In Germany, users aged 14 or 15 need authorization from a parent or legal guardian under Art. 8 GDPR before the explicit wellness-data consent can take effect; from age 16 the user can consent for themselves. The guardian confirms the disclosed recipients and purposes through a single-use link that expires after 48 hours. After successful confirmation, the request and token hash are deleted immediately; a daily database job removes expired requests. They can withdraw authorization through the contact address above; the user can also stop future processing in the app at any time.',

Cloud data remains until the account is deleted. Technically necessary backups may expire according to the retention periods of the respective processor.',

The photo, Base64 working copy, prompt and typed raw text are not stored for this purpose. An hourly job clears the result after 22 hours. The request ID, status and allowance type then remain for at most 30 days to prevent duplicate calls and abuse; RevenueCat webhook IDs remain for at most 90 days for deduplication. Account deletion immediately cascades to these Kandro records.',

Switching analytics off stops future transmission and clears the random local analytics identity and pending event queues. PostHog never receives the Supabase account ID, so previously sent events cannot be joined to the deleted Kandro account. Apple may keep purchase and subscription history as long as needed for restoration, billing, fraud prevention or legal duties.
