 * a rejected email, the evening notification. Threading the dictionary through
 * every signature would touch call sites that have nothing to do with language,
 * so the provider publishes it here instead and non-React code reads it.
 *
 * English is the starting value because it is the app's default language; the
 * provider overwrites it during its first render, before any screen mounts.
